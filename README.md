## Features

- Save social media account links: Users can add and store their social media handle links within the extension popup.
- Shortcut substitution: By typing specific shortcuts such as `$twitter` or `$linkedin` in any input box, the corresponding shortcut will be replaced with the user's saved link for that social media platform.
- Easy management: The extension provides a user-friendly interface for adding and deleting social media account links.
- Secure storage: Social media account links are securely stored within the browsers storage and remain accessible only to the user.

## Installation 

I will be adding the extension to the Extension App Stores soon.

1. Download the latest release from <https://github.com/Alkaison/Link-Saver-Extension/releases>
2. Extract the zip file to any directory you'd like, though you need to make sure the directory is not deleted while you want to use the extension.
3. Go to extensions page in Chrome (URL: `chrome://extensions`)
4. Enable Developer Mode by toggling the switch at the top right corner.
5. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory where the extension files are located.
6. The extension will be added to Chrome, and its icon will appear in the toolbar.

## Usage

Once the extension is installed, follow these steps to save and use your social media account links:

1. Click on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar to open the extension popup.
2. In the popup, click on the "Add Link" button.
3. Enter a label for the social media platform (e.g. "twitter", "linkedin") and the corresponding URL for your account.
4. Click "Confirm" to store the link.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for any other social media accounts you wish to save.
6. To use a saved link, simply type the corresponding shortcut (e.g., `$twitter` or `$linkedin`) in any input box, and it will be replaced with the saved link.
